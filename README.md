## Features
- Procedurally generated clouds
- Car model built from basic geometry and elements. Complicated shapes are created using boolean operations on these primitives.
- Lighting is attached to car, with position and orientation updated each frame.
- Car can be animated easily

## Game?
I'll probably turn this into a game after exploring some of the features of three.js that seem interesting to me.
