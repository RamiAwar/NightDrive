## Features
- Procedurally generated clouds
- Basic car model built from primitive threejs elements. Complicated shapes are created using boolean operations on these primitives
- Dynamic lighting which is attached to the car, with its position and orientation updated each frame
- Easily animatable car

## Game?
I'll probably turn this into a game after exploring some of the features of three.js that seem interesting to me.
