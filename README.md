## Features
- Game framework with collision detection and different performance settings
- Procedurally generated clouds
- Basic car model built from primitive threejs elements. Complicated shapes are created using boolean operations on these primitives
- Dynamic lighting which is attached to the car, with its position and orientation updated each frame
- Easily animatable car

## Future Work
- More performance improvements by limiting collision checks, making lighting controllable from settings menu, controlling shadows from settings menu, controlling camera settings from settings menu...
- Adding fuel tank collectables
- Adding touch and keyboard controls
- Experimenting with sphere instead of cylinder for a ground, allowing for more freedom in movement.
